# lightsout-gfn

Experimental [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/) (with [NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.3/experimental/nnx/index.html)) codebase using [GFlowNets](https://milayb.notion.site/The-GFlowNet-Tutorial-95434ef0e2d94c24aab90e69b30be9b3) to solve 3x3 [LightsOut](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40273-9_13) puzzles.

Experiment tracking with [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/).

Dependencies managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

- **Train**: `uv run -m train`.
- **Monitor**: `uv run mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`
- **Infer** (with a GUI / to GIF): `uv run -m infer ./some_checkpoint`

## Why?

As of writing, I am very new to both NNX and GFlowNets. This is a way for me to familiarize myself with them, using a toy environment: 'Lights Out!'.

This is a small pilot experiment, cobbled together quickly. Feel free to tell me what I'm doing wrong in the GitHub issues!

## Sample output

Expect convergence in under a minute on a RTX 4060 laptop GPU.

```
‚ùØ uv run -m train

```

This should converge within tens of seconds on a RTX 4060 laptop GPU.


## Disclaimers and remarks

- A $$N \times N$$ grid has $$2^{N^2}$$ states. For 3x3, this is just $$2^9 = 512$$ states; this is nothing and can easily be memorized. However, the point here was to show that, and how, the GFlowNet training objective could be used in order to learn how to solve this game.
- The code as it stands has data leakage. Partitioning based on starting states is insufficient, due to the effect of sampled actions.
- It would be much more meaningful to do this on bigger grids. Better yet, to use a Transformer or other sequence model in order to generalize across grid sizes.
- There have long been [deterministic solvers for LightsOut](https://github.com/pmneila/Lights-Out). This repository is not attempting to beat them, or to be more than a proof of concept.
